## My process

### Built with

- React useReduce Hook
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Styling library


### What I learned

It was an awesome oportunity to practice the useReduce Hook, setting up actions and managing the states with reducers. It was also my first project using styled components for the theme management and general styling.


### Continued development

The next step of this project is to implement responsiveness to port it to mobile view.
